NE: hexagon with a dot in the middle
ES: Three vetrical lines and one horizontal line
WS: * with 12 dots surrounding it

Middle of compass: an upside v with a dot between the legs

# Things that will be helpful to know for the rock:

1. Places where the rock can actually be hiding:
    - Forests
    - ~~Parks~~
        - ArcGIS
            - https://chluyu7llsleoj1k.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f092c20803a047cba81fbf1e30eff0b5
        - General
            - Idaho Falls https://www.idahofallsidaho.gov/Facilities?clear=False
    - ~~Any public spaces, really (they hid it at a library once!)~~

2. Nearby landmarks 
    - Bodies of water (This is already shown on the map in blue)
    - ~~Museums~~
    - Churches
    - Restaurants?

3. Facts about the general area or hiding spot
    - ~~historical~~
    - ~~events currently being held (like a parade where theres food)~~ (THIS WILL NEED TO BE SEARCHED SEPARATELY)
    - ~~Altitude (which parts are hilly)~~

4. (The rock WONT be hiding)
    - Farms (Just keep in mind)
    - Homes (Just keep in mind)
    - Any Private Property (The Bodifi Rock will not be hidden within 50ft of any commercial building or residence.)
    - Places of business
    - "Keep off" signage

# Overarching ideas for program to help us find the rock
Note: If I cannot find a way to show the different filters on my own ArcGIS app, I can always use this -> https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html

- ~~Implement ArcGIS to pinpoint all the parks/forests (1)~~
- ~~ArcGIS for any sort of public spaces (1)~~
- ArcGIS for any nearby landmarks: Bodies of water, museums, churches, restaurants. (2)
- ~~ArcGIS for altitude (3d)~~
- ArcGIS for  places that are private property: they will not hide the rock there. (4)

# How it will fit into the modules:
4: ArcGIS (For displaying all of the feature layers as described above)
5: A Webapp that will hold the ArcGIS app
(I will then put it on glitch so we can use it on the run when finding the rock)

# Researching program (simplicity is key)
- Have all the feature layers implemented with appropriate popups. 
- ~~Use a database (Module 5 stretch challenge) that will hold the facts about each location and display the results (like mod. 2) EASY: Already implemented in ArcGIS~~

# Key components for the on-the-search program
- ~~Must be able to access it as a website (so use glitch)~~
- With the database: store custom notes about each location to store progress in the hunt *

# How to utilize hints given at 8AM (Facebook and Instagram will also have the hints)
- Run synonyms of key words against different locations' facts *
