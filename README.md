# ArcGIS-Mapping
Showcase all of the different parks in the Rexburg/Idaho Falls locations

# Overview

Here I decided to figure out how to use another rest api endpoint with a token accessed by ArcGIS to understand how to configure a map in the web.

# Development Environment

I used the ArcGis library along with javascript and HTML to display the map in the browser.

# Useful Websites

(Make a list of websites that I found helpful in this project)
* [ArcGis Website: Creating a feature Layer](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/data-hosting/tutorials/tools/create-a-new-feature-layer/#add-data)
* [Display a map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/display-a-map/)
* [Idaho Falls Parks Map](https://www.idahofallsidaho.gov/Facilities?clear=False)

# Future Work

* Add a filter for the markers based on altitude
* Add some more feature layers
* Have a legend that shows the different locations in IF, such as schools and churchers
